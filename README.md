By selecting "Saved Leases" in the navigation bar, the user is brought to the Saved Leases tab. If this is their first time using the application, no saved leases will appear. After the user has saved a lease calculation, it will be stored locally to the browser and appear here until the user chooses to delete it.

In order to calculate a lease payment, the user will first enter information about the vehicle in the "Car Information" section of the calculator. Next, they will input several values which will be used to calculate their monthly lease payment including the price of the vehicle, down payment, residual value of the vehicle, the money factor, tax rate, and the lease term and annual mileage. Users who are unfamiliar with any of these variables can click the "Lease Information" heading to reveal definitions for each of these variables. Clicking the "Lease Information" heading again will hide these definitions.

If the user has not entered a value into any input field, they will not be able to calculate their payment, and will be prompted to fill the empty field(s). Any empty fields will be outlined for the user to see clearly.

After all fields have been filled, the user can click the "Calculate Payment" button. This will calculate their lease payment and reveal a table providing a detailed breakdown of all components that factor into their monthly payment, as well as the total costs over the entire lease term.

To calculate another lease, the user can navigate back to the Calculator tab and click the "Calculate New Lease" button. If the current lease calculation has not been saved, the user will be alerted when they click the "Calculate New Lease" button. This provides them with an opportunity to save the lease calculation before it is erased. If the user does not want to save the lease calculation, they can choose to proceed with a new calculation.
